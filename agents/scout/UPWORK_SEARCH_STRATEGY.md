## 2. The Traffic Light Vetting System

### Step A: Client Vetting (The Foundation)
| Signal | Metric | Disqualifier (🔴 RED) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payment** | Status | **Unverified** |
| **Rating** | Client Stars | **< 4.0 Stars** |
| **Hire Rate** | Historical | **< 30%** |
| **Avg Rate** | Budget | Significant mismatch to JP range |
| **Location** | Region | Hard legal/timezone restrictions |

### Step B: Job Fit (The Resonance)
Cross-reference requirements against `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/Jon_Paul_Resume_Unabridged.md`.
- **Fit Score:** Calculated confidence level based on matched evidence (GREEN/YELLOW/RED).

---

## 3. The "Gate" Rule (Mandatory)
If **EITHER** the Client Vetting **OR** the Job Fit is **🔴 RED**, the Scout must **STOP** and recommend a **PASS**. 

*Note: User Override is permitted, but the default recommendation is to decline.*

---

## 4. Reporting Standard
All findings must be presented in a clean table including:
- Role Title
- Client Score (Vetting)
- Fit Score (Jon-Paul resonance)
- Posted Time (Freshness)
- **Verdict:** (🔴/🟡/🟢)
