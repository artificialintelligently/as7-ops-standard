## Candidate Files for Deletion

| # | Path | Pattern Matched | Size | Modified | Status |
|---|------|-----------------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `proactive-triage/SKILL.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 1.6KB | Feb 16, 2026 | Confirmed present |
| 2 | `agents/auditor/AGENTS.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 1.6KB | Feb 16, 2026 | Previously detected |
| 3 | `agents/guard/AGENTS.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 993B | Feb 16, 2026 | Previously detected |
| 4 | `skills/hubspot-basic/SKILL.md.bak-20260214-170513` | `*.bak` | 1.3KB | Feb 14, 2026 | Previously detected |
| 5 | `skills/hubspot-basic/bin/hubspotctl.bak-20260214-170513` | `*.bak` | 4.5KB | Feb 14, 2026 | Previously detected |

## Pattern Analysis

- `*.bak` matches: **5 files**
- `*.tmp.bak` matches: **0 files**
- `*~` (editor backups): **0 files**
- `*.swp` / `*.swo` (vim temp): **0 files**

---

## Additional Observations

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `.backup-test.log` | Test log file in root (not a backup artifact - retained) |
| Archive directory | Clean - no backup files detected |
| `.git` directories | Properly excluded per policy |

---

## Dry-Run Results

| Action | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Deleted | 0 |
| Quarantined | 0 |
| **Remaining for Review** | **5** |

---

## Exclusions Applied (per policy)

- `.git/**` - excluded (protected)
- `.openclaw/**` - excluded (system directory)
- `node_modules/**` - excluded (not present)

---

## Risk Assessment

All candidate files:
- ✅ Within approved workspace root
- ✅ Match approved cleanup patterns (`.bak`)
- ✅ Are older than 7 days (retention threshold satisfied)
- ⚠️ Agent config backups may contain historical configurations worth preserving

---

## Recommendations

Based on OpenClaw best practices (docs.openclaw.ai):

1. **Safe to delete**: `proactive-triage/SKILL.md.bak-*` - skill file backup, 5+ days old
2. **Safe to delete**: `skills/hubspot-basic/*` - skill backup from Feb 14 (7+ days old)
3. **Review recommended**: Agent configuration backups in `agents/auditor/` and `agents/guard/` - verify no historical configs needed before deletion

---

## Compliance Notes

- ✅ Dry-run mode active - no destructive operations performed
- ✅ Audit trail maintained via this report
- ✅ Least privilege: workspace-only scope enforced
- ✅ Fail-closed: uncertain items flagged for review

---

## Next Steps

To execute cleanup (requires Director approval):
1. Review candidate list above
2. Confirm agent config backups are safe to remove
3. Run with `--execute` flag or confirm via Director
