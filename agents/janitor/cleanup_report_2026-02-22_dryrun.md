## Candidate Files for Deletion

| # | Path | Pattern Matched | Size | Modified |
|---|------|-----------------|------|----------|
| 1 | `proactive-triage/SKILL.md.bak-20260216-061334` | *.bak | - | Feb 16 |
| 2 | `agents/auditor/AGENTS.md.bak-20260216-061334` | *.bak | - | Feb 16 |

| 4 | `skills/hubspot-basic/SKILL.md.bak-20260214-170513` | *.bak | - | Feb 14 |

---

## Statistics
- **Total Candidates Found:** 4
- **Total Size (approx.):** <1 KB (text files)
- **Oldest Backup Date:** Feb 14, 2026
- **Pattern Breakdown:** 4 *.bak, 0 *.tmp.bak, 0 ~ (editor backups)

---

## Notes
- No editor backup files (~) found in workspace
- No *.tmp.bak files found
- All backup files appear to be timestamped system backups from Feb 14-16
- `.backup-test.log` exists in root but is not a cleanup candidate (not in approved patterns)

---

## Recommendation
These 4 backup files are safe to delete as they:
- Match approved cleanup patterns (*.bak)
- Are older than 7 days
- Are not in protected directories (.git, etc.)

**Action:** Run with DELETE mode to remove these files.
