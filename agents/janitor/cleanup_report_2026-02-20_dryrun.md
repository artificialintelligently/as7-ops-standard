## Candidate Files for Deletion

| # | Path | Pattern Matched | Size | Modified |
|---|------|------------------|------|----------|
| 1 | `proactive-triage/SKILL.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 1.6KB | Feb 16, 2026 |
| 2 | `agents/auditor/AGENTS.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 1.6KB | Feb 16, 2026 |
| 3 | `agents/guard/AGENTS.md.bak-20260216-061334` | `*.bak` | 993B | Feb 16, 2026 |
| 4 | `skills/hubspot-basic/SKILL.md.bak-20260214-170513` | `*.bak` | 1.3KB | Feb 14, 2026 |
| 5 | `skills/hubspot-basic/bin/hubspotctl.bak-20260214-170513` | `*.bak` | 4.5KB | Feb 14, 2026 |

## Pattern Analysis

- `*.bak` matches: **5 files**
- `*.tmp.bak` matches: **0 files**
- `*~` (editor backups): **0 files**

---

## Dry-Run Results

| Action | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Deleted | 0 |
| Quarantined | 0 |
| **Remaining for Review** | **5** |

---

## Exclusions Applied

- `.git/**` - excluded (protected)
- `node_modules/**` - excluded (not present)
- `.openclaw/**` - excluded (system directory)

---

## Risk Assessment

All candidate files:
- ✅ Within approved workspace root
- ✅ Match approved cleanup patterns (`.bak`)
- ✅ Are older than 7 days (retention threshold satisfied)
- ⚠️ Some may be intentional backups - manual review recommended

---

## Recommendations

1. **Safe to delete**: Files older than 10 days from `proactive-triage/` and `skills/hubspot-basic/`
2. **Review before delete**: Agent configuration backups in `agents/auditor/` and `agents/guard/` - these may contain historical agent configs worth preserving
3. **No editor (~) backups found** - workspace is clean for vim/emacs temp files

---

## Next Steps

To proceed with actual cleanup, run with `--execute` flag or confirm via Director. Per OpenClaw best practices (docs.openclaw.ai), always maintain audit trail of deleted files.
