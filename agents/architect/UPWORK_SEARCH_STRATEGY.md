## ✅ GREEN FLAG Signals

### Certifications (Hard Requirements)
| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **HubSpot Academy Certified** (Implementation Specialist or Developer) | Proves formal HubSpot competence, not just "used it once" |
| **HubSpot Partner Badge** | Real-world implementation experience, not tutorial-level |
| **Salesforce + HubSpot cross-certification** | Shows enterprise CRM understanding |

### GitHub Portfolio Traits
| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **API integration repos** (HubSpot, REST APIs) | Concrete evidence of technical capability |
| **Automation scripts** (Node.js, Python) | Shows ability to build what Phase 2 requires |
| **Clean commit history** (not just 1 commit 3 years ago) | Sustained technical engagement |
| **README documentation quality** | Attention to detail = will document your implementation |

### Tech Stack Combinations (The "Sweet Spot")
| Combo | Role Fit |
|-------|----------|
| **HubSpot + Python/Node.js + API** | Phase 2 implementation lead |
| **HubSpot + Zapier/Make + Webhooks** | Automation builder |
| **HubSpot + JavaScript + Chrome Extensions** | Custom tooling |
| **HubSpot + SQL + Data Migration** | Legacy data migration |
| **HubSpot + OpenAI/GPT API + Automation** | AI integration (Phase 3) |

### Profile Signal Boosters
- **"Former Agency" or "Partner" in headline** - knows enterprise workflows
- **Portfolio link with live implementations** - can show, not just tell
- **Response time < 2 hours** - demonstrates availability/seriousness
- **100%+ Job Success Score** - proven track record

## 🚩 RED FLAG Signals (AI-Overstaters)

| Red Flag | Detection Method |
|----------|------------------|
| **"AI Expert" but no GitHub** | Claims AI/ML but zero code samples |
| **Vague tech stack** | Says "full stack" but can't name frameworks |
| **Copy-paste proposals** | Uses generic templates ("I am a HubSpot expert...") |
| **No verifiable portfolio** | "I can't share due to NDA" for EVERY project |
| **Overpromising timeline** | "I can do this in 2 days" for complex work |
| **No technical interviews** | Refuses live coding or architecture discussion |
| **Rate too low for scope** | <$50/hr for enterprise HubSpot = inexperienced or ghosting risk |
| **Profile photo = AI-generated** | Not a reliable indicator alone, but correlates with fake profiles |
| **Zero LinkedIn or LinkedIn doesn't match Upwork** | Inconsistent identity |
| **"I know everything about HubSpot"** | HubSpot is huge - no one does. Specificity matters. |
