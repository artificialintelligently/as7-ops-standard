# Upwork Job Radar Protocol (JP)

## 🎯 The Objective
Jon-Paul (JP) is a **Systems Architect & Operational Leader** (Fractional COO / AI Systems Architect). He is **THE FREELANCER**, not the client. We are searching for high-level roles that match his "Dual Stack" (IT Infrastructure + Operations).

## 🚦 Traffic Light Vetting System (The Criteria)
Every job found must be scored using these specific signals:

- **🟢 GREEN (The Must-Haves):** 
  - **Freshness:** Posted within the last 24 hours.
  - **Client Rating:** > 4.0.
  - **Client Hire Rate:** > 30%.
  - **Profile Fit:** High-stakes operational leadership (Fractional COO, Chief of Staff, EOS Integrator) or advanced AI architecture (n8n, Agentic AI, Multi-agent orchestration).
- **🟡 YELLOW:**
  - Good fit but slightly lower client metrics, minor skill gap, or posted 24-48 hours ago.
- **🔴 RED (Auto-Reject):**
  - Posted > 48 hours ago.
  - Low-level VA work.
  - Vague project specs.
  - Poor client history/rating (<4.0 or low hire rate).

## 📡 Search & Scrape Protocol
- **Primary Method:** Use the **Browser Relay** (Port 18792). Upwork is heavily protected against standard web-fetching; we must scrape live tabs while JP is logged in.
- **Query:**
  `("Chief of Staff" OR COO OR "Fractional COO" OR "Head of Operations" OR "Director of Operations" OR "Operations Manager" OR RevOps OR "Revenue Operations" OR "VP Operations" OR "VP of Operations" OR "Operations Executive" OR "Business Operations" OR "AI Systems Architect" OR "AI Architect" OR "Automation Lead" OR n8n OR "Agentic AI" OR "AI Agents" OR "AI Automation" OR "Workflow Automation")`

## 📝 Reporting Format
Always provide a summary table of all **GREEN** and **YELLOW** leads including:
1. **Job Title** (with the direct Upwork Link).
2. **Posted** (Time/Date since posting).
3. **Color Score** (🟢 Green / 🟡 Yellow).
4. **Strategic Fit Score** (1-10).
5. **Director's Diagnosis:** Brief analysis of why it fits JP's Dual Stack profile.
