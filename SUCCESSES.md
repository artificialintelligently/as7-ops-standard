# 🤝 The Promise: "Diagnosis Before Build"

I don't sell "quick fixes." I treat your business like a system.
1. **Audit First**: I analyze your workflow to find the real bottleneck.
2. **Document**: We create the SOP before we build the bot.
3. **Deploy & Train**: I hand off fully documented systems and train your team.

> "Most developers hand you code. I hand you a business asset."
