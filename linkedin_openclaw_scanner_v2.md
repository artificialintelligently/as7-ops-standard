**The AI agent wild west just got a sheriff.**

If you haven't been following the buzz, Astrix Security just released the **OpenClaw Scanner**. It’s a free, open-source tool specifically designed to detect OpenClaw (also known as MoltBot) deployments running across your organization’s endpoints.

**Why this matters for your security posture:**

Autonomous AI agents like OpenClaw are game-changers for productivity, but they’re often running as "Shadow AI"—operating without centralized oversight. These agents can execute commands, access local files, and authenticate to internal systems like Salesforce, GitHub, and Slack. 

Recent research has highlighted potential risks where misconfigured instances could inadvertently expose API keys or cloud credentials. For security teams, the challenge is simple: you can't secure what you can't see.

**How the OpenClaw Scanner works:**

- **Zero Friction:** It uses a read-only analysis of existing EDR telemetry (like CrowdStrike or Microsoft Defender).
- **Non-Invasive:** No new agents are installed on your endpoints.
- **Privacy-First:** No data is transmitted externally; all reports stay within your environment.

As Ofek Amir, VP of R&D at Astrix Security, noted: “The new scanner was purpose-built for enterprise organizations to safely utilize a read-only approach over EDR logs without executing code on endpoints or sharing data outside the organization.”

We’re entering an era where AI agents won't just be tools we use, but persistent members of our digital environments. The arrival of detection tools like this signals that the security community is finally catching up to the speed of agentic AI.
