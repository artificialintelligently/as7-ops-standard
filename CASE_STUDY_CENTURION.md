# Case Study: Centurion Jets
**Operational Architecture & Strategic Automation**
**Date:** February 19, 2026

## 1. Client Overview
- **Client:** Mearon Okonsky (Centurion Jets)
- **Industry:** Private Aviation — Charter Brokerage
- **Problem:** Operational bottleneck. Solo broker doing everything (sourcing, negotiating, accounting) with zero time for follow-up or lead cultivation.
- **Engagement:** Build an autonomous infrastructure on a dedicated Mac Mini.

## 2. Identified Friction Points
1. **Zero Post-Trip Follow-up:** High-value repeat business left on the table.
2. **Manual Data Entry:** 10+ leads/day typed manually into HubSpot.
3. **Stale Leads:** Thousands of untouched contacts with no re-engagement plan.
4. **Empty Leg Sourcing:** Sifting through emails/WhatsApp for repositioning flights is a manual "grind."
5. **Platform Costs:** Avinode API fees are prohibitively expensive ($1k-$2k premium).

## 3. The Architect's Solution
- **Phase 1: Revenue Recovery.** HubSpot "Stale Lead" resurrection via Voice DNA outreach and automated Social Authority posts.
- **Phase 2: The Blue Ocean Engine.** Multi-source "Empty Leg" parser matching inbound newsletters against live ADSB positioning data.
- **Phase 3: Workflow Assist.** Browser-based automation for Avinode to eliminate manual entry without incurring API premiums.

## 4. Key Takeaway
This isn't a "bot" project. It's a **Business Asset** deployment. We are building a machine that allows a solo broker to operate with the throughput of a 5-person agency.
