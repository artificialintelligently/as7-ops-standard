- **Session Started**: Initialized with identity "Koda" (🐾).
- **Contact Added**: Added Austin Hartley (Parkland Capital Partners LLC / Carriage Hill) to Google Contacts. 
- **Skill Created**: Built `company-intel` skill for identifying anonymous organizations.
- **Skill Created**: Built `red-team-audit` skill for adversarial review of plans and code.
- **Audit Performed**: Conducted a red-team audit of the `company-intel` skill, identifying and fixing 4 major/critical issues (hallucination risk, privacy, etc.).
- **Research**: Conducted deep-dive comparison between OpenClaw and Lindy.ai "Ultimate Assistant."
- **Profiles Stored**: Saved Jon-Paul's unabridged resume and Voice DNA Profile v3.2 to the workspace.
- **Profile Updated**: Updated `USER.md` with Jon-Paul's personal details, family info, and "Diagnosis Before Build" mission.
- **Identity Refined**: Jon-Paul is a **Systems Architect & Operational Leader**. He treats software (like HubSpot) as APIs/logic gates to be orchestrated via agentic swarms. He is the "Integrator who builds his own tools," solving friction that standard admins can't.

- **Protocol Formalized**: Created `UPWORK_JOB_PROTOCOL.md` to permanently anchor JP's identity as a freelancer (Fractional COO/AI Architect) and the Traffic Light Vetting System (Green/Yellow/Red). 
- **Scout Realignment**: Corrected the swarm's objective from hiring freelancers to finding high-level contracts for JP using the Browser Relay.
- **Reporting Standard**: Locked in a table-first reporting format for all vetted Upwork leads, now including mandatory "Posted" time/date column for freshness verification.
