# AS7 SYSTEM MANIFEST: Parkland Capital Operations
**Status**: CALIBRATED (State: 2026-02-15)
**Director**: Koda (🐾)
**Mission**: "Diagnosis Before Build" — Bringing order to chaos through audited AI orchestration.

---

## 1. The Operational "Engine"
All swarm activities are governed by the **Director's Audit Gate**.

### A. The Mandatory Audit Protocol (Hard-Coded)
- **Source**: `AGENTS.md`
- **Rule**: No external/destructive action (Email, HubSpot, Deletion) without a snapshotted Logic Plan.
- **Verification**: Every deliverable must pass a `red-team-audit`.
- **Failure Path**: CRITICAL/MAJOR findings trigger a 1-cycle self-correction before user escalation.

### B. Voice & Identity
- **Authority**: `VOICE_DNA_JP.md`
- **Constraint**: All outgoing drafts must be audited for "Expert Neighbor" tone. No generic bot-speak permitted.
- **User Context**: `USER.md` (Integrator/Systems Architect persona).

## 2. Active Specializations (The Swarm)
| Role | Primary Tool/Skill | Operational Guardrail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Director** | `red-team-audit` | Mandatory quality gate; logic-bomb detection. |
| **Scout** | `company-intel` | Must perform "Conflict Resolution" if signals are missing. |
| **Guard** | `proactive-triage` | Ignore automated notifications; focus on high-priority human leads. |
| **Architect** | `deep-thought` | Defines the HubSpot "Mirror Property" and API logic gates. |

---

## 3. System Specs (Phase 2 Status)
### HubSpot Architecture (`Parkland_HubSpot_Spec_v1.md`)
- **Pattern**: Two-Tier Shadow Schema.
- **Key Asset**: `ai_semantic_memory_buffer_v1` (The Context Ledger).
- **Status**: Phase 1 (Read-only) verified; Phase 2 (Write/Audit) pending token activation.

### Upwork Vetting (`UPWORK_JOB_PROTOCOL.md`)
- **Protocol**: Traffic Light (Green/Yellow/Red).
- **KPIs**: Client Rating >4.0, Hire Rate >30%, Posted <24h.
- **Fallback**: Use `web_search` if Browser tool is restricted.

---

## 4. Maintenance & Backups
- **State Integrity**: All absolute paths have been converted to logical references to prevent environment-shift "logic bombs."
- **Backup Strategy**: Local workspace state is manually verified after every successful Audit loop.
