# OpenClaw Use Cases: Centurion Jets

## Strategic Overview
These use cases are designed to transition Mearon Okonsky from a manual charter broker to an architect of an autonomous aviation brokerage.

### 1. Real-Time Empty Leg Matching (The Competitive Edge)
*   **Mission:** Match informal aircraft inventory to active client demand.
*   **Workflow:** OpenClaw monitors parsed empty-leg routes from operator newsletters and cross-references them with active client trip requests in HubSpot.
*   **Value:** Instant notification of high-margin matches that a human would miss in the noise of a busy inbox.

### 2. Stale Lead Recovery (The Revenue Generator)
*   **Mission:** Monetize dormant data in the CRM.
*   **Workflow:** OpenClaw scans HubSpot for leads with no activity in 60+ days and drafts highly personalized, low-pressure re-engagement emails.
*   **Value:** Reactivates the "quoted but never booked" list using Mearon's specific tone and expertise.

### 3. Avanode Browser Navigation (The Cost Saver)
*   **Mission:** Autonomous research without expensive API overhead.
*   **Workflow:** OpenClaw uses its browser tool to search for aircraft availability and extract pricing directly from the Avanode web portal.
*   **Value:** Saves thousands in API fees while maintaining real-time data access.

### 4. "Dual-Stack" Voice Calibration
*   **Mission:** Ensure AI outputs are indistinguishable from the owner.
*   **Workflow:** OpenClaw continuously ingests Mearon’s sent emails and transcripts to refine a persistent `SOUL.md` and `VOICE_DNA.md`.
*   **Value:** 100% brand consistency across automated emails, LinkedIn posts, and client briefings.

### 5. Automated Lead Enrichment & Briefing
*   **Mission:** Instant intelligence on new prospects.
*   **Workflow:** Upon new lead arrival, OpenClaw performs instant OSINT (LinkedIn, news, company data) and sends a "Scout Briefing" to Mearon’s Telegram.
*   **Value:** Provides immediate context for high-value sales calls, increasing closing probability.

### 6. Airport Normalization Engine
*   **Mission:** Data integrity for operational accuracy.
*   **Workflow:** Intercepts informal location inputs (e.g., "The Hamptons") and resolves them to authoritative ICAO codes (e.g., KHTO).
*   **Value:** Eliminates quoting errors caused by ambiguous airport names or regional slang.

### 7. Post-Trip "Relationship Continuity"
*   **Mission:** Automate client retention and reviews.
*   **Workflow:** Triggers 30/60/90-day follow-ups after a trip closes, specifically tailored to the client's past travel preferences.
*   **Value:** Recovers "lost" repeat business that typically slips through the cracks during busy periods.

### 8. Content Engine (LinkedIn/Blog)
*   **Mission:** Build independent authority and SEO.
*   **Workflow:** Drafts expert-level blog posts about aviation trends or "Empty Leg Explainers" using unique data from the local database.
*   **Value:** Reduces dependence on 3rd-party lead partners (Air Charter Advisors) by building a direct audience.

### 9. Morning CRM "Prioritization" Briefing
*   **Mission:** Daily operational focus.
*   **Workflow:** Reviews the HubSpot pipeline every morning and identifies the top 3 deals with the highest "probability of close" for manual follow-up.
*   **Value:** Prevents Mearon from being overwhelmed by volume, focusing effort on high-impact revenue.

### 10. Operator Newsletter Parser (Quality Gate)
*   **Mission:** High-fidelity data extraction.
*   **Workflow:** Filters raw text from operator emails for "Confidence" and "Relevance" before committing to the database.
*   **Value:** Ensures the matching engine is only working with accurate, up-to-date aircraft positions.
